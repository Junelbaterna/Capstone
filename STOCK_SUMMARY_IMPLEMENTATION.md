# Stock Summary & Movement Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive stock summary and movement tracking functionality for the Enguio Project inventory management system. When products are entered from warehouse, the system automatically records data in both `tbl_stock_movement` and `tbl_stock_summary` tables as requested.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Stock Movement Tracking
- **Automatic Recording**: When products are entered from warehouse, stock movements are automatically recorded in `tbl_stock_movements`
- **Movement Types**: Supports IN (addition), OUT (subtraction), and ADJUSTMENT movements
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Tracks who made changes, when, and why
- **Batch Integration**: Links movements to batch records for complete traceability

### 2. Stock Summary Management
- **Real-time Updates**: Stock summaries are automatically updated when movements occur
- **Batch-level Tracking**: Maintains separate summaries for each batch
- **Available vs Total Quantities**: Tracks both available and total quantities per batch
- **Expiration Date Tracking**: Monitors expiration dates for each batch

### 3. StockSummary Component (`app/Inventory_Con/StockSummary.js`)
- **Dashboard View**: Overview with key statistics and recent movements
- **Movements View**: Detailed table of all stock movements with filtering
- **Summary View**: Current stock levels across all products and batches
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by product, location, movement type, date
- **Export Functionality**: Export data to CSV format
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark/light theme support

### 4. API Endpoints Added/Enhanced

#### `get_stock_adjustments`
- Retrieves stock movement records with pagination
- Supports filtering by type, search term, status
- Returns detailed movement information

#### `get_stock_summary` (NEW)
- Retrieves stock summary data with pagination
- Supports filtering by location, search term, category, stock status
- Returns comprehensive product and batch information

#### `get_stock_adjustment_stats`
- Provides statistical overview of stock movements
- Counts additions, subtractions, and adjustments
- Calculates net quantity changes

### 5. Database Integration
The system integrates with existing database tables:
- `tbl_stock_movements`: Records all stock movements
- `tbl_stock_summary`: Maintains current stock levels per batch
- `tbl_product`: Main product information
- `tbl_batch`: Batch tracking information
- `tbl_location`: Location management
- `tbl_supplier`: Supplier information

## How It Works

### Warehouse Entry Flow
1. **Product Entry**: When a product is entered from warehouse via the existing `add_product` API
2. **Batch Creation**: A batch record is created with reference number
3. **Stock Movement**: An 'IN' movement is recorded in `tbl_stock_movements`
4. **Stock Summary**: A summary record is created/updated in `tbl_stock_summary`
5. **FIFO Integration**: The system integrates with existing FIFO stock management

### Transfer Flow
1. **Transfer Creation**: Products are transferred from warehouse to store
2. **OUT Movement**: An 'OUT' movement is recorded for the source location
3. **IN Movement**: An 'IN' movement is recorded for the destination location
4. **Summary Updates**: Both locations' stock summaries are updated

## Usage

### Accessing Stock Summary
1. Navigate to the StockSummary component
2. Choose between Dashboard, Movements, or Summary views
3. Use filters to narrow down results
4. Export data as needed
